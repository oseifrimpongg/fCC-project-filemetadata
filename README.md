The last challenge to earn a Backend Certification :), this was suprisingly too easy (I suppose they wanted it to be fun on the last project), just opened a documentation and I was able to complete it. If you are reading this and aspiring to code, just do it, it feels great when you jump all the hurdles and earn the certification.
